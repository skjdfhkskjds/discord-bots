# Discord Bots
These are some fun discord bots written in Python using the Discord.py API

## List of Bots:

> ### `1. Stock Portfolio Bot`
> 
> This bot is a stock portfolio tracker, where each user (indicated by their Discord username) can store their stock portfolio through add and remove commands to a MySQL database and call another command to view their progress and performance. Information about stocks are retreived with the YFinance API.

> ### `2. Trivia Bot`
> 
> This bot accesses the py-trivia API to obtain questions and responses, and tracks a user's score and generates a leaderboard stored on a Repl.it DB.

> ### `3. The Rock Bot`
> 
> This bot is purely a for fun bot that produces everything involving Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Whenever the keyword 'rock' is invoked in chat, the bot will respond to that mention by printing a funny variation of the rock accompanied by some explanatory text. (e.g. "You've heard of the rock, let me introduce you to the wok) Additionally, there is an inspire command to which the bot will reply with the rock's verse in Face Off.
